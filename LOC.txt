Although our system is a bit smaller than the expected size at _______ LOC,
we argue that this measure does not define our project or the effort we put into 
it. We believe this metric is somewhat counterintuitive, because as programmers 
we've been taught to optimize code and make everything as concise as possible. 
Thus, we put extra effort into having more efficient code, rather than focusing 
on system size. Additionally the mathematical and conceptual rigor of building 
this system represents more effort than its physical size.
